## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :This is project coffeeshop.

This website helps our fellow customers see our recipes with video (which i iframed off the web) so they can see how some of your items are made. also allows our customers to book tables (using a label/input and making some of the fields required) thru the website and we share our coffee menu (where i created 3 seprate ul/li for each menu to space them out accordingly and used a border-bottom to make the underscore equal to eachother) thru the website so new time customers know before hand what we serve and the price of our items at the bottom we have a about (in the about title i made it look more interesting to viewers but adding a oulsate animation and added a circle to the about title) our store section where customers can quickly click a link that will take them to our social media page where they can learn more about our coffeeshop.

in the future i would like to make our headers more colorful(using different colors for each header and use linear-gradiant for our backgrounds) and stand out, also on the form section i would like to add some box shadow and add some animation to the triple espresso logo making it pulsate.
